## üìä Project Overview

This C++ project implements a comprehensive plant nursery management system for COS 214, showcasing object-oriented design principles and software design patterns in C++.
It involves a variety of features and interactions, such as being able to view plants, create orders and take care and monitor plant growth and many more.

## üéØ Design Patterns Overview

This project demonstrates 10+ Gang of Four design patterns working in harmony:
- **Creational**: Abstract Factory, Prototype
- **Structural**: Decorator, Composite
- **Behavioral**: State, Command, Chain of Responsibility, Iterator, Memento, Mediator, Observer

Each pattern addresses specific domain problems in plant nursery management while maintaining clean separation of concerns and extensible architecture.
